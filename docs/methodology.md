## What nami does

A user describes a forward-looking market scenario in natural language ("60% US tariffs on
China imports, prolonged trade war"). nami:

1. Asks Gemini to pick 2–5 **historical analog events** from a curated registry whose
   *mechanism* matches the scenario.
2. Pulls the **realized factor returns** over each analog's window from yfinance and
   computes an **empirical envelope** (mean / p10 / p90 / count) per factor.
3. Asks Gemini to write a **grounded narrative** about the scenario (Google Search active
   → real news citations) and then, in a separate sub-call, **extract structured factor
   shocks + periphery shocks** that stay inside the empirical envelope.
4. Estimates the portfolio's **factor betas** via mean-centered ridge OLS on 3 years of
   weekly returns, applies the shocks, and returns a portfolio P&L with attribution.

Every forward-looking claim in the narrative is **cited** to a real source the LLM
retrieved during grounding. Without citations the pipeline refuses to return.

## Portfolio construction

**Holdings & weights.** A portfolio is a set of equity (or yfinance-supported) tickers with
weights summing to 1.0. The four sample books are **cap-weighted** — `weightᵢ = marketCapᵢ / Σ
marketCap` — from a **frozen, dated snapshot** (`app/data/sample_portfolio_weights.json`),
regenerated offline by `scripts/refresh_sample_weights.py`. Cap-weighting is a deliberate
approximation of true free-float index weights: it is reproducible, requires no paid feed, and
is a large step up in realism from equal-weighting (a developed-world book is ~10% Apple, not
2% of everything). The runtime **never scrapes** — drifting weights would silently change P&L
and poison the scenario cache — so refreshing the snapshot is an explicit, reviewable step.
Each book is asserted single-currency before weighting (the developed-world proxy uses US-listed
ADR lines so it is all-USD; the Japan book is all-JPY), because cap ratios are only meaningful
within one quote currency.

**Benchmark & active return.** Each book carries a benchmark ticker (sample books built-in —
MSCI World→URTH, US Tech→QQQ, Defensive→SPLV, Japan→EWJ; custom books optional). The benchmark
is evaluated as a **one-holding portfolio** run through the *same* factor shocks the scenario
produced, giving a benchmark return; **active return = portfolio return − benchmark return**.
This is computed as a post-pipeline overlay (never cached) so it always reflects the book's
current benchmark, and it shares the engine's linearity caveat — it is a *factor-model* estimate
of relative performance under the shock, not a realized tracking result.

**Sector & country exposure.** Each ticker carries a sector and country tag (baked into the
snapshot from yfinance classification). Exposure breakdowns sum portfolio weight and scenario
P&L contribution within each bucket. These are coarse Yahoo classifications (≈ GICS-lite), not
licensed GICS, and are display-only — they do not enter the factor model.

**Cash sleeve.** A reserved `CASH` line is a **zero-exposure** position: zero factor beta, zero
scenario return, no periphery shock. Its weight dilutes the rest of the book (cash drag) but it
never contributes to P&L and is never fetched from market data. In mark-to-market mode a `CASH`
quantity is a **USD amount** (marked at 1.0), not a share count. An all-cash book is rejected —
there is nothing to shock.

**Out of scope (v1).** Cost-basis / tax-lot accounting, multi-currency *reporting*, long/short
net-gross, blended benchmarks, and non-equity asset classes are intentionally excluded — they
require paid data or accounting machinery beyond an equity scenario explorer.

## Factor universe (22 factors)

All factors are tickers fetched via yfinance; each weekly "return" is the percent change in
the factor's adjusted-close price. These are **tradeable-ETF proxies** for systematic risk
factors, chosen for liquidity and observability rather than the canonical Fama-French
portfolio-sort construction ([Fama & French, 1993](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304405X93900235);
[Fama & French, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X14002323);
the momentum style factor MTUM follows the [Carhart, 1997](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1997.tb03808.x)
construction at the ETF level).

| group | factors |
|---|---|
| **Market** (2) | SPY (`SPY`), ACWI (`ACWI`) |
| **Sectors** (11 GICS) | XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLI, XLY, XLP, XLU, XLB, XLRE, XLC |
| **Styles** (5 MSCI) | MTUM, QUAL, VLUE, SIZE, USMV |
| **Macro** (4) | TNX (`^TNX`), DXY (`DX-Y.NYB`), VIX (`^VIX`), OIL (`CL=F`) |

Unit convention: percent change of the weekly close. For macro indices that means percent
change in the *level* (so a VIX shock of `+0.50` = the VIX index spiking by 50%, e.g.
15 → 22.5). The full description per factor is in [`app/factors/universe.py`](../app/factors/universe.py).

**Pre-launch dates** matter for the analog matcher — events before a factor's ETF launch
return NaN for that factor and are excluded from its envelope count:

| factor | first available |
|---|---|
| Style ETFs (MTUM/QUAL/VLUE/SIZE/USMV) | 2013 |
| XLRE | 2015 |
| XLC | 2018 |
| ACWI | mid-2008 |

## Beta estimation

`app/factors/regression.py::estimate_betas` runs **mean-centered ridge OLS** on weekly
returns:

```
X̃ = X − mean(X, axis=0)            # T × F factor returns, centered
Ỹ = Y − mean(Y, axis=0)            # T × N ticker returns, centered
β̂ = solve(X̃ᵀX̃ + αI_F, X̃ᵀỸ)      # F × N — vectorized over tickers
```

- Default lookback: 156 weeks (3 years) per `Config.beta_lookback_weeks`.
- Default ridge `α = 0.1` per `Config.ridge_alpha` — stabilizes against the collinearity
  between SPY/ACWI/XLK and between sector ETFs ([Hoerl & Kennard, 1970](https://doi.org/10.1080/00401706.1970.10488634)).
- Mean-centering removes the through-origin bias when returns have nonzero historical
  means (equivalent to including an unpenalized intercept and discarding it). Why it
  works: the normal equations for `[X, 1] @ [beta; mu]` decouple — the intercept row
  gives `mu = mean(Y) - beta^T mean(X)`, and substituting back recovers the centered
  system. Mean-centering keeps the ridge penalty away from the intercept; penalizing
  the intercept would shrink portfolio alphas toward zero, which is a substantive
  modeling choice we don't want the regularizer to make.
- Uses `np.linalg.solve` instead of `inv` — more numerically stable, and vectorizes
  cleanly across all tickers in one call.

The unit test `test_estimate_betas_recovers_known_coefficients` (with zero-mean factors)
and `test_estimate_betas_handles_nonzero_factor_means` (with drift) prove the
implementation recovers known coefficients within 0.05 of truth.

## Historical analog matcher

`app/factors/analogs.py` loads a curated registry of 17 historical market-stress events
from [`data/historical_events.yaml`](../data/historical_events.yaml), spanning 2007–2025.
Each event has:

- `id` — stable kebab-case identifier (e.g. `covid-crash-2020`)
- `start_date`, `end_date` — daily-precision window (inclusive on both ends)
- `tags` — subset of `{trade-war, pandemic, inflation, geopolitical, banking, energy, central-bank, currency}`
- `description` — what happened and why it's a useful analog

For a given subset of event IDs, `compute_envelope` returns a per-factor DataFrame with
`mean`, `p10`, `p90`, and `count`:

- **Total return over the event window** (not weekly average) — `price[end] / price[start] − 1`
  using daily bars from yfinance. Daily precision so short events like the Aug 2024 yen
  carry unwind (7/31 → 8/5) are captured accurately rather than rounding to the wrong week.
- **Mean / p10 / p90** computed nan-aware across the selected events.
- **`count`** lets the LLM down-weight low-coverage factors (XLC has only post-2018
  observations; for events before then it's missing).

The custom YAML loader (`_UniqueKeyLoader`) refuses duplicate event_ids — silent overwrite
would create hard-to-debug coverage gaps.

---

## LLM pipeline

`app/llm/scenario.run_scenario` orchestrates two Gemini calls + one structured extraction.

### Call 1 — Analog selection (`select_analogs`)
- Input: scenario text + `event_summaries()` (JSON of all 17 events)
- No grounding tool, structured-output schema `AnalogSelectionOutput`
- Output: 2–5 event IDs the LLM thinks share the scenario's *mechanism*

### Call 2a — Grounded narrative (`_grounded_narrative`)
- Input: scenario + envelope + factor universe + holdings
- **Google Search tool ON**, NO `response_schema` (free-form text)
- Output: 3-5 sentence narrative citing recent market news

### Call 2b — Structured extraction (`_extract_structured_shocks`)
- Input: the grounded narrative from 2a + envelope + factor universe + holdings
- NO tools, `response_schema=ShockProposalOutput`
- Output: structured `FactorShock` + `PeripheryShock` list

**Why the split?** Gemini 3.5 Flash on Vertex AI honors `response_schema` faithfully but
frequently skips invoking `google_search` when both are passed in one config. The result is
valid JSON with no grounding metadata — i.e., the narrative *looks* current but isn't
actually sourced. We refuse to return that. Splitting into two sub-calls guarantees the
narrative is grounded (2a) and the structured output is well-formed (2b).

The grounded narrative is generated **once** (outside the validation retry loop) — only 2b
retries on validation errors, so a schema fix doesn't trigger redundant web grounding.

### Validation + repair
`app/llm/validation.validate_shock_proposal` rejects:
- Factor shocks for factors not in `FACTORS`
- Periphery shocks for tickers not in the portfolio
- Duplicates
- Factor shocks outside `[p10, p90]` **when `count >= 3`**. Below that threshold the
  band collapses (count=1: a single point; count=2: a 2-point span) and rejection on
  floating-point divergence between the LLM's emitted value and the envelope is
  unjustifiable, so the band check is skipped. The LLM is still shown the envelope in
  the prompt and is separately instructed to "down-weight factors with `count < 3`" —
  that prompt guidance remains the only constraint at low count.

On validation failure, 2b is re-asked once with the errors embedded in the user message.
A second failure raises.

---

## Periphery shock layer

In addition to factor-driven returns, the LLM may propose name-specific *idiosyncratic*
shocks. These are **additive** on top of `β · factor_shock`:

```
return[i]              = (β · factor_shock)[i] + periphery_shocks.get(i, 0)
by_ticker_factor[i]    = w[i] · (β · factor_shock)[i]
by_ticker_periphery[i] = w[i] · periphery_shocks.get(i, 0)
by_ticker_total[i]     = by_ticker_factor[i] + by_ticker_periphery[i]
by_factor[f]           = (Σᵢ w[i] · β[i,f]) · factor_shock[f]
total_pnl              = Σᵢ by_ticker_total[i] = Σ_f by_factor[f] + Σᵢ by_ticker_periphery[i]
```

The two channels are **orthogonal** under this attribution — factor and periphery sum
independently to the total. Phase 8 (now shipped) added Conditional Shapley with the
three variants documented below; Shapley redistributes credit *within* the factor
channel only, never across the factor/periphery boundary.

**Constraint**: periphery shocks may only reference tickers present in the portfolio.
Enforced at three layers: the shock extraction prompt instructs the LLM to limit periphery
to held tickers; `validate_shock_proposal` rejects violations; `portfolio_pnl` itself
raises `ValueError` for unknown tickers as a belt-and-braces check. Rationale: an
idiosyncratic shock to a ticker you don't hold has zero weight and therefore zero P&L
impact — accepting it silently would mislead users into thinking their portfolio has
exposure to that name.

---

## Factor attribution: Naive vs Conditional Shapley

The engine returns **two** per-factor attribution dictionaries on every scenario:
`by_factor_naive` (always) and `by_factor_conditional_shapley` (when the historical
factor-return background is available). The Results-tab toggle picks which one to
render.

### Why naive attribution misleads under correlation

Naive attribution is the direct algebra:

```
by_factor_naive[f] = (Σᵢ wᵢ · βᵢ,f) · shock[f]
```

This sums exactly to the factor-driven P&L and is dead simple to interpret — but it
**assumes factor independence**. In practice SPY and ACWI move together (ρ ≈ 0.95),
XLK is essentially SPY plus a tech-tilt, and sector ETFs co-move during stress. If
the LLM shocks SPY while leaving ACWI unshocked, naive attribution gives ACWI exactly
zero credit even though ACWI is what the SPY shock *implies* about global equities.
Conversely, two near-identical factors that are both shocked can have their credit
arbitrarily split based on which factor the LLM happened to name first.
[Aas, Jullum, Løland (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2021.103502) motivates
dependent-feature approximations to SHAP — measuring co-variation in the historical
joint distribution rather than treating each feature in isolation — as the appropriate
fix for this kind of correlation-driven attribution distortion.

### Conditional Shapley axioms

Shapley values are the unique axiom-compliant credit allocation among ([Shapley, 1953](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400881970-018/html)):
- **Efficiency** — `Σ_f shapley[f] == factor-driven P&L`
- **Symmetry** — factors with identical marginal effect get equal credit
- **Linearity** — composing two games linearly composes the Shapley values
- **Null player** — a factor with zero coefficient gets zero credit

For the linear-model implementation we use [SHAP's `LinearExplainer`](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/8a20a8621978632d76c43dfd28b67767-Abstract.html)
with a `maskers.Impute` background ([Lundberg & Lee, 2017](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/8a20a8621978632d76c43dfd28b67767-Abstract.html)).

### What Conditional Shapley is NOT

**It is not a causal "true" attribution.** Conditional Shapley is *data-dependent
credit allocation under the historical conditional joint distribution* of factor
returns. A factor with zero explicit LLM shock can receive nonzero Conditional
Shapley credit because it is correlated with one that *was* shocked — the model's
prediction at the conditional expectation differs from the prediction at the
marginal expectation.

[Janzing, Minorics, Blöbaum (2020)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/janzing20a.html)
frame this as a *modeling choice*: observational (conditional) and interventional
Shapley answer different questions about feature attribution, and neither is universally
"correct" — the choice depends on whether you want attribution under the empirical
joint distribution or under feature-wise toggles. [Chen, Janizek, Lundberg, Lee (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16234)
develop the same observation in depth ("True to the Model or True to the Data?").
This is the price of axiomatic credit allocation, not a bug, but it does mean
Conditional Shapley should be read as "how much of the move is *explained by* factor
f under the historical co-movement structure" rather than "how much would change if
we toggled f in isolation."

The UI surfaces this honestly: rows labelled "No explicit LLM shock; attributed via
correlation" show up only under Conditional Shapley, for factors the LLM didn't name
but which received Shapley credit through correlation.

### Implementation

`app/factors/attribution.py::conditional_shapley_attribution` uses the
non-deprecated `shap` API:

```python
masker    = shap.maskers.Impute(background)
explainer = shap.LinearExplainer((aggregated_coefs, 0.0), masker)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(shock_vec)
```

where `aggregated_coefs = (weights @ betas)` collapses the N × F beta matrix into the
portfolio-level F-vector of factor exposures. The background is the demeaned,
dropna'd historical weekly factor-return matrix supplied by
`fetch_factor_returns_history` (≥52 complete rows required — `RuntimeError` otherwise).
The 52-row floor is one year of weekly observations — the minimum for the 22-factor
covariance matrix to be well-conditioned. With fewer rows, the sample covariance is
rank-deficient or noise-dominated, and the `Impute` masker's conditional expectations
become numerically unreliable. In practice the strict `dropna(how='any')` across all
22 factors yields 300+ surviving rows (post-XLC 2018+), well above the floor.

**Critical:** the background must NOT be `fillna(0)`'d. Zero-filling a missing ETF's
returns manufactures false zero-correlation that contaminates the Shapley values.
Strict dropna across all 22 factors effectively restricts the background to the
post-XLC-launch window (mid-2018+); this is correct — older windows can't carry the
modern factor universe's correlation structure.

### Worked example

Two factors, ρ = 0.9, only F0 explicitly shocked:

| | F0 (shocked −5%) | F1 (no shock) |
|---|---|---|
| Naive | −5% × β = full credit | exactly 0 |
| Conditional Shapley | ~−2.5% credit | ~−2.5% credit (via correlation) |

Both attributions sum to the same factor-driven P&L. Conditional Shapley distributes
the credit across the correlated peer.

### When to use which

- **Naive** for quick intuition when factors are roughly independent or when the
  reader needs to see exactly which factors the LLM named.
- **Conditional Shapley** for axiom-compliant attribution when factors are known to
  be correlated — i.e. most of the time in equities. Default when available.

### Variants: full, explicit-only, grouped

Conditional Shapley ships in three flavors. All three are computed best-effort
whenever a sufficient factor-return background is available; the API/UI surfaces
all three under `PortfolioPnL.by_factor_conditional_shapley*` fields and the
frontend picks which to render. The taxonomy of Shapley operationalizations is
discussed in [Sundararajan & Najmi (2020)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/sundararajan20b.html);
group-aware approaches related to (but distinct from) nami's grouped variant include
[Frye, Rowat, Feige (2020)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/0d770c496aa3da6d2c3f2bd19e7b9d6b-Abstract.html)
on asymmetric Shapley values and [Owen (1977)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-45494-3_7)
on coalition-structure values.

| Variant | Players in the Shapley game | Sums to | When to read |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Full** (`by_factor_conditional_shapley`) | All F factors in the universe | Factor-driven P&L (efficiency axiom) | "How would credit flow under the full historical joint distribution?" |
| **Explicit-only** (`by_factor_conditional_shapley_explicit`) | Only the factors the LLM explicitly shocked; unshocked factors stay at exactly 0.0 | Factor-driven P&L (sub-game over shocked factors, under the demeaned-background contract) | "Restrict attribution to factors the model actually named." Matches the user's mental model when reading "what did the LLM shock?" |
| **Grouped** (`by_factor_conditional_shapley_grouped`) | G=4 factor groups (market / sector / style / macro); within-group credit redistributed to members by naive weight | Factor-driven P&L (efficiency preserved) | "Collapse within-group leakage (SPY ↔ ACWI, MTUM ↔ QUAL) and only Shapley-allocate cross-group correlation." |

**Within-group aggregation**: `conditional_shapley_attribution_grouped` aggregates
member returns and shocks within each group by **SUM**, not average. Sum preserves
`Σ aggregated_shock = Σ raw_shock` and so preserves the efficiency property at the
factor level. Average would distort correlation structure for groups with many
members and would break efficiency unless rescaled.

**Redistribution within a group**: each group's Shapley value is split among its
members proportionally to `(wᵀβ)_f · shock[f]` — the naive within-group share. The
practical effect: a group's credit lands on the factor the LLM actually shocked, not
on its correlated peers. If all member shocks are 0, the group's value (also
typically ~0) is split uniformly across members for transparency.

**This redistribution rule is a design choice unique to nami, not derived from a
Shapley-style axiom system.** It preserves efficiency by construction (by-naive-share
within each group), and it has the UX property that shocked factors absorb the group's
credit instead of correlated peers leaking credit to them. Alternative redistribution
rules — uniform within-group, or [Owen (1977)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-45494-3_7)-style
coalition values that recursively apply Shapley within each group — would yield
different per-factor attributions but the same group-level sums.

**Zero-group detail**: when no member of a group was explicitly shocked, `total_naive`
for that group is exactly 0.0 and the naive-share denominator would divide by zero. The
code falls back to `phi_f = phi_group / |group|` (uniform split). In practice `phi_group`
is near-zero for an all-unshocked group — the full Shapley game attributes most credit to
groups whose members were shocked — but it can be nonzero when cross-group correlation is
high. The uniform fallback is a transparency choice, not a mathematical necessity.

**Why explicit-only exists.** The full variant is mathematically clean but reads
strangely to users: a SPY-only shock can produce a noticeable ACWI/QUAL contribution
because `shap.maskers.Impute` measures the marginal effect of an *omitted* factor
against the conditional expectation given the shocked ones. With SPY/XLK/MTUM
heavily negative, the conditional expectation of ACWI/QUAL is also negative, so a
zero shock is "better than expected" and earns positive offsetting attribution.
That's correct under the axiomatic credit-allocation framing — but a user reading
"the model attributed P&L to a factor I didn't shock" sees a bug. Explicit-only is
the variant that matches the user's mental model.

**Why grouped exists.** The 21-factor view spreads correlated-peer leakage across
many factors (SPY/ACWI/XLK/MTUM/QUAL all moving together swamps the cross-group
signal). The grouped view collapses within-group leakage into naive and
Shapley-allocates only cross-group correlation, which is the more interesting
signal for a portfolio P&L story.

### Worked example: end-to-end with all four variants

A concrete walkthrough using 3 factors (SPY, XLK, VIX) and a 2-ticker portfolio
(AAPL 60%, MSFT 40%). All numbers below were generated by running the actual
`estimate_betas`, `apply_shocks`, and attribution functions on synthetic 60-week data
with known correlation structure (SPY/XLK ρ ≈ 0.84, SPY/VIX ρ ≈ −0.47).

**Step 1 — Beta estimation** (mean-centered ridge OLS, α = 0.1):

```
              SPY      XLK       VIX
  AAPL     0.2232   0.2910   -0.1550
  MSFT     0.1701   0.2252   -0.1498
```

Betas are ridge-shrunk from true generating values (SPY/XLK multicollinearity
shares load across the two) — this is expected behavior, not a defect.

**Step 2 — LLM shocks**: SPY = −5%, XLK = −8%, VIX = +40%

**Step 3 — Per-ticker expected return** (`β @ shock_vec`):

```
  AAPL: 0.2232 × (−0.05) + 0.2910 × (−0.08) + (−0.1550) × (+0.40) = −9.64%
  MSFT: 0.1701 × (−0.05) + 0.2252 × (−0.08) + (−0.1498) × (+0.40) = −8.64%
```

**Step 4 — Periphery**: AAPL gets −3% idiosyncratic (earnings miss); MSFT gets 0%.

**Step 5 — Portfolio P&L**:

```
  Ticker  Weight   Factor  Periphery    Total  Weighted
  AAPL     60%    −9.64%    −3.00%    −12.64%   −7.59%
  MSFT     40%    −8.64%     0.00%     −8.64%   −3.46%
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Factor-driven P&L:  −9.24%
  Periphery P&L:      −1.80%
  Total portfolio:   −11.04%
```

**Step 6 — Naive attribution** (`(Σᵢ wᵢ · βᵢ,f) · shock[f]`):

```
  SPY:  (0.6 × 0.2232 + 0.4 × 0.1701) × (−0.05) = 0.2020 × (−0.05) = −1.010%
  XLK:  (0.6 × 0.2910 + 0.4 × 0.2252) × (−0.08) = 0.2647 × (−0.08) = −2.117%
  VIX:  (0.6 × −0.1550 + 0.4 × −0.1498) × (+0.40) = −0.1529 × (+0.40) = −6.115%
  Sum = −9.243% ✓ (matches factor-driven P&L)
```

VIX dominates because its shock is large (+40%) and the portfolio has meaningful
negative VIX betas (VIX up → equity down).

**Step 7 — All four attribution variants compared**:

| Factor | Naive | Full Conditional | Explicit-only | Grouped |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SPY | −1.010% | −0.441% | −0.553% | −0.426% |
| XLK | −2.117% | −1.653% | −1.578% | −1.573% |
| VIX | −6.115% | −7.148% | −7.111% | −7.244% |
| **Sum** | **−9.243%** | **−9.243%** | **−9.243%** | **−9.243%** |

Observations:
- **Efficiency**: all four variants sum to the same −9.243% factor-driven P&L.
  (Explicit-only always sums to factor-driven P&L: the sub-game's grand-coalition
  value is `Σ_{f∈shocked} (wᵀβ)_f · shock[f]`, which equals factor-driven P&L
  because unshocked factors contribute zero to factor-driven P&L anyway. The
  distinguishing property is that unshocked factors stay at exactly zero — no
  correlation-driven credit. Step 8 below shows this concretely.)
- **SPY vs XLK redistribution**: under Naive, SPY gets −1.01% and XLK gets −2.12%.
  Under Conditional Shapley, SPY drops to −0.44% because its effect is partially
  captured by its correlated peer XLK. The credit isn't lost — it's redistributed.
- **VIX absorbs more**: Conditional Shapley pushes VIX from −6.12% to −7.15%. VIX is
  inversely correlated with SPY/XLK, so its Shapley value exceeds its naive share.

**Step 8 — What happens when VIX is unshocked** (same SPY/XLK shocks):

| Factor | Naive | Full Conditional | Explicit-only |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPY | −1.010% | −1.445% | −1.118% |
| XLK | −2.117% | −2.173% | −2.010% |
| VIX | 0.000% | **+0.491%** | **0.000%** |
| **Sum** | **−3.127%** | **−3.127%** | **−3.127%** |

This is where the variants diverge meaningfully:
- **Naive** gives VIX exactly 0 — it was not shocked.
- **Full Conditional** gives VIX **+0.49%** (positive!) — because SPY/XLK are down,
  the conditional expectation of VIX is *up*; a zero VIX shock is "better than the
  model expected," so VIX earns positive offsetting credit.
- **Explicit-only** keeps VIX at exactly 0 — it restricts the Shapley game to
  {SPY, XLK} only. This matches the user's mental model: "I didn't shock VIX, so
  VIX shouldn't appear in my attribution."

### Choosing the right attribution method

| Question | Naive | Full Conditional | Explicit-only | Grouped |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **What does it show?** | Credit proportional to `(wᵀβ)_f · shock[f]` | Axiom-compliant credit under historical co-movement | Shapley restricted to LLM-shocked factors; unshocked = 0 | Cross-group Shapley + within-group naive redistribution |
| **Sums to factor P&L?** | Yes (exact) | Yes (efficiency axiom) | Yes (sub-game on shocked factors only) | Yes (efficiency preserved) |
| **Unshocked factor credit?** | Always zero | Can be nonzero via correlation | Always zero | Zero within-group; possible via cross-group correlation |
| **Best when...** | Quick sanity check; factors roughly independent | Axiom-compliant full allocation; correlated equities | User wants attribution only on factors the LLM named | Suppress within-group leakage (SPY ↔ ACWI, MTUM ↔ QUAL) |
| **Confusing when...** | Correlated factors split credit arbitrarily | Credit appears on factors nobody shocked | Gap between sub-game total and factor P&L is large | Group definitions feel arbitrary |

**Rule of thumb**: start with **Grouped** for presentation-quality factor stories — it
collapses the noisy within-group leakage that makes full Conditional hard to narrate.
Use **Naive** for a fast sanity check or when the audience needs to see exactly which
factors the LLM proposed. Use **Full Conditional** when you need every cent accounted
for under the historical joint distribution. Use **Explicit-only** when the audience
objects to seeing credit on factors the model didn't name.

## Fixed-context shock attribution (narrative decomposition)

The opt-in "Run decomposition" action splits the scenario text into N ∈ {2, 3, 4}
self-contained sub-narratives and assigns each its exact Shapley value over the payoff
`v(S) = total_pnl(run_scenario(" ".join(S)))`, with `v(∅) := 0`.

**Fixed context.** Each subset run **pins the source scenario's analog set** and uses the
**analog-only narrative path (no Google re-grounding)** — so the only thing that varies
across subsets is the shock proposal for that fragment's text. This makes `v(S)`
deterministic and reproducible (modulo temperature + cache), versus the earlier design
that re-selected analogs and re-grounded per subset (noisy, news-dependent).

**What it measures — and doesn't.** This is *decomposition sensitivity*: the marginal
shock each theme adds **within the original analog context**. It is NOT a causal
decomposition (a fragment in isolation may still propose different shocks than it does in
context). The UI and this caption label it "experimental / illustrative" for that reason.
When a portfolio value is set, each contribution is also shown in dollars
(`shapley_value · NAV`).

**UX + cost.** Served over SSE (`/api/scenarios/decompose-stream`) so the UI shows
"X / Y subset runs". Cost: `2^N − 1` runs (empty subset is the hardcoded zero) — N=4 is
15 runs (~30–90s, ≈ $0.015). N is capped at 4 (N=5 = 31 runs, too long for a synchronous UX).

Both Shapley sums (factor-level and narrative-level) satisfy the **efficiency axiom**
exactly (modulo float noise); pinning analogs + skipping re-grounding removes the
news-drift variance the narrative-level sum previously carried.

## Reproducibility & caching

- `temperature=0` on every Gemini call.
- The scenario response is keyed by SHA256 of:
  ```
  scenario_text.strip().lower()
  + sorted(portfolio_holdings)
  + portfolio_key                  # "us_tech_growth" / "custom" / ...
  + market_date.isoformat()
  + vertex_model_id                # gemini-3.5-flash
  + PROMPT_VERSION                 # bumped for any prompt OR schema change
  + factor_universe_version()      # 12-char hash of FACTORS dict
  + events_version()               # 12-char hash of historical_events.yaml
  ```
- TTL = 7 days (`LLM_CACHE_TTL_DAYS`) on cache reads.
- Cache backend: `CloudStorageCache` (GCS, prefix `scenario_cache/`), JSON serialized via
  `ScenarioResult.model_dump(mode="json")`. Tests inject `InMemoryCache` instead.

`PROMPT_VERSION` is the single invalidation lever: bumping it forces every cached scenario
to be re-derived against the new prompts / schema. Same-day re-runs of an unchanged scenario
hit cache in <500ms; the 7-day TTL forces eventual refresh against drifted news.

## Mark-to-market valuation

By default nami works in **return space**: a portfolio is a set of weights and P&L is a percentage. There are two ways to see dollars:

- **Notional dollar view** (any run, including visitors): apply a **portfolio value (NAV)** as a post-run control. Because the engine is linear, every dollar figure is just `field × NAV`, recomputed **instantly in the browser** as you change the value — no re-run, no marking. Nothing is "marked"; it is a notional scaling of the weights. Per-position value here is `weight · NAV`.
- **Mark-to-market** (admin, share quantities): enter **share counts** and nami marks each position to the as-of close + FX (below), deriving an authoritative NAV and price-derived weights.

Both surface the same **original → stressed** view: `stressed_value = value + NAV·by_ticker_total[t]`, `stressed_NAV = NAV·(1 + total_pnl)`, and per-name `Δ% = delta / value` (the position's scenario return).

**Marking (share-quantity mode).** For each holding nami fetches the **raw** (un-split/dividend-adjusted) daily close on the as-of date — a dedicated fetch, distinct from the adjusted-close series used for return modelling, because valuing a share count needs the actual traded price. Each position is converted to USD:

```
position_value_usd[i] = shares[i] · raw_close[i] · pence_scale[i] · fx_to_usd[ccy(i)]
NAV                    = Σ position_value_usd[i]
weight[i]              = position_value_usd[i] / NAV        (price-derived; drifts from any target)
```

The quote currency is inferred from the Yahoo exchange suffix (e.g. `.T` → JPY; `.L` → GBP quoted in **pence**, so the price is divided by 100; no suffix → USD). FX uses explicit, direction-checked pairs (e.g. `USDJPY=X` inverted to USD-per-JPY) marked on the **same as-of date**, and the per-instrument close date and per-currency FX date are recorded.

**Dollars are a linear overlay.** Because the factor engine is linear in weights, the entire dollar view is the return-space result scaled by NAV — no separate dollar P&L is computed or stored:

```
total $ P&L         = total_pnl · NAV
position $ P&L[i]   = by_ticker_total[i] · NAV          (the weight cancels exactly)
post-shock value[i] = position_value_usd[i] + by_ticker_total[i] · NAV
```

**Vintage consistency.** A backdated MTM run marks at the as-of date's raw close and the as-of FX rate, so the valuation carries no look-ahead — consistent with the rest of the backdating contract.

**Fail-closed.** If any requested position cannot be marked (missing, stale, delisted) or an FX rate is unavailable, the run **fails with an error** rather than silently returning a percentage-only result — a requested valuation is never quietly degraded.

**Caching.** The scenario cache stores the **return-space** result only; NAV, marks, and FX are recomputed after retrieval and never persisted, so the same scenario at a different NAV can never serve stale dollars. The share-quantity *inputs* are cached (they are deterministic and part of the cache key) so a cache hit or a shock adjustment can re-mark.

**Limitations (v1).** USD reporting only; long positions only (no shorts); no cost basis or realised/unrealised split; currency is suffix-inferred (not security-master-grade); portfolio snapshots store weights, not share counts. The analog envelope and factor shocks are unaffected by MTM — it is a valuation layer over the same scenario engine.

## Calibration evidence

See [`docs/backtest_results.md`](backtest_results.md) for the live-LLM evaluation snapshot
and the semantic invariants enforced by `tests/test_live_evals.py`. The in-pipeline validator
already guarantees factor shocks stay inside the empirical envelope; the live evals add
mechanism-level smoke checks (pandemic → pandemic-tagged analog selected; banking crisis →
XLF beats SPY to the downside; Taiwan scenario → semis appear in periphery).

## What this is NOT

- **Not a regulatory stress engine.** No Basel SA/IMA, no FRTB, no CCAR/DFAST. The phrase
  "scenario explorer" is deliberate to avoid the regulatory-stress framing.
- **Not real-time risk.** Designed for one-shot scenario evaluation, not live position
  monitoring.
- **Not multi-asset.** Equity-only in v1; fixed income, FX, and commodities are deferred.
- **Not deterministic in narrative wording.** Shocks are reproducible by cache hash;
  narrative text varies slightly across runs even at `temperature=0`.
- **Not investment advice.** Period.
